## Graduate (MSc) Programs

* **EE6317 – Chip Security with Machine Learning, MSc (Electronics)**
    The objective of this course is to provide graduate students with an understanding of security challenges in chip design and manufacturing, and how machine learning can be used to address them. Students will learn to identify and mitigate hardware vulnerabilities such as hardware trojans, counterfeit ICs, and side-channel attacks.

* **NM6008 – Digital IC Design Lab for NTU-TUM MSc (IC Design)**
    This course provides students with practical experience in the fundamentals of digital integrated circuit (IC) design and automation. Students will master architectural concepts and design methodologies required to integrate complex systems into a single circuit. The lab emphasises hands-on skills in signal processing and circuit verification to meet the high-performance demands of modern communication devices and large-scale transistor integration.
    
* **EE6309 – VLSI Systems, MSc (Electronics)**
    This course explores the design and analysis of complex VLSI systems, focusing on data security, system noise considerations, and high-speed synchronization. Students examine memory organization and performance, alongside advanced concepts in parallel and pipeline processing architectures. The module also covers essential methodologies for system design verification and testability to ensure robust and reliable integrated circuit performance.

## Undergraduate Programs

* **EE4344 – Analysis and Design of Integrated Circuits**
    This course covers the analysis and design of CMOS analog integrated circuits. Topics include MOS transistor modelling, single-stage amplifiers, differential amplifiers, current mirrors, frequency response, and operational amplifier design. Students also explore stability, compensation, and the use of CAD tools for circuit simulation and layout.

* **EE3019 – Integrated Electronics**
    This course introduces the principles of integrated circuit fabrication and the operation of fundamental semiconductor devices. It focuses on the analysis and design of analog electronic circuits, including feedback amplifiers, power amplifiers, and tuned amplifiers, as well as the characteristics of differential and operational amplifiers.

* **IE2104 – Digital Electronics**
    This course provides a foundation in digital logic design. It covers number systems, Boolean algebra, logic gates, and the minimization of logic functions. Students learn to design combinational circuits (such as adders and multiplexers) and sequential circuits (including flip-flops, counters, and registers) using standard MSI/LSI components.

* **CET919 – Design for Trust**
    Part of the Continuing Education and Training (CET) curriculum, this course focuses on hardware security and trust throughout the IC lifecycle. It covers techniques for detecting hardware trojans, ensuring IP protection, and implementing hardware-based security primitives like Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs).

* **CET921 – Side-Channel-Attacks & Countermeasures**
    This course delves into the physical security of cryptographic implementations. Students study various side-channel attacks, including Power Analysis (SPA/DPA) and Electromagnetic Analysis, and learn to implement effective countermeasures at both the algorithmic and architectural levels to protect sensitive data from physical leakage.
