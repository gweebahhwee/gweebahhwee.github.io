Hi! I’m **Bah-Hwee**, an Associate Professor at the [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/eee/), [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg), Singapore. I currently serve as the **Associate Chair (Students)** for the School of EEE and am the **Director** of the [National Integrated Centre for Evaluation (NiCE)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/nice).

My work focuses on the intersection of **hardware security, asynchronous circuit design, and machine learning**. I have a long-standing interest in hardware assurance and the development of secure architectures, having 5 US patents granted in these domains. Beyond my academic roles, I am deeply involved in the innovation ecosystem as a co-founder of two start-ups, *Async2Secure* and *Advanced Electro acoustics*, bridging the gap between fundamental research and commercial application.

Within the global research community, I am heavily involved with the [IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (CASS)](https://ieee-cas.org/). I currently chair the CASS Distinguished Lecturer Program and have served as the General Chair for several flagship conferences, most recently **ISCAS 2024**. I also serve on the editorial boards of *IEEE CAS Magazine* and *IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems*, where I help shape the discourse around the future of integrated circuits and systems.
